# ML
Machine Learning course by Stanford University on coursera
Instructor: Andrew Ng
This course will help on understanding how to apply the most advanced machine learning algorithms to problems such as anti-spam, image recognition, clustering,
building recommender systems, and many other problems. 

It's also on how to select the right algorithm for the right job, as well as become expert at ‘debugging’ and figuring out how to improve a learning algorithm's performance.

This course uses octave/R programming. We can even use matlab to test these codes.
